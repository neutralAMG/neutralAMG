## 👋 My name is Alejandro Moscoso

**`Digital Craftman (Developer/ Problem Solver)`**

I’m a software Developer with solid foundations in programing and a focus on learning and applying various technologies to solve real life problems. Passionate about problem-solving, teamwork, and delivering impactful solutions. Committed to continuous growth as a developer and contributing to innovative projects in the tech industry. 
All my projects stem from a personal need that I want to solve, a desire to improve and learn a new language, trying new ideas on how to solve problems, Uni Homework or just a meme that only I would find funny (those are private though). Al my projects are build from the ground up. My process usually goes like this:

Idea > Desing Structure > Pseudocode > Implementation > Testing > Upload.
